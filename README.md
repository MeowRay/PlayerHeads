PlayerHeads
===========

Bukkit Plugin - Drops a player's head when s/he dies, also mob heads

http://www.curse.com/server-mods/minecraft/player-heads

===========

Experimental development into converting the plugin to use Textured heads instead of using usernames for mob skins.

This branch is unfinished and untested - you probably want the `master` branch instead which has been tested and shims the old plugin to work with the 1.13 API without the redesign.
