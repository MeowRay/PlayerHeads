===========

This version is undergoing testing - there may be significant behavior changes.

If you want a version supporting 1.13+ that tries to maintain the old behavior, see the `3.x` branch or any 3.x releases.

## What's New?
### Textured Mobheads
* Old, hard-to-maintain, hard-to-replace username-based heads are on the way *out*. ("Legacy Heads")
* Heads with texture-urls are *in* for good. (easily searchable on many sites)
* Legacy heads are still recognized by the plugin, and when broken are converted to updated versions.
### All current mobs supported
* Want a head from a phantom? An illusioner? How about a Cod? You can get one now.
### 1.13 and 1.13.1-ready
* You need one of the shiniest versions if you want all these new heads.
