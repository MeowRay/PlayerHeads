===========

Bukkit Plugin - Drops a player's head when s/he dies, also mob heads

http://www.curse.com/server-mods/minecraft/player-heads

===========

Experimental development into converting the plugin to use Textured heads instead of using usernames for mob skins.

This branch is undergoing testing - there may be significant behavior changes 

## What's New?
### Textured Mobheads
* Old, hard-to-maintain, hard-to-replace username-based heads are on the way *out*. ("Legacy Heads")
* Heads with texture-urls are *in* for good. (easily searchable on many sites)
* Legacy heads are still recognized by the plugin, and when broken are converted to updated versions.
### All current mobs supported
* Want a head from a phantom? An illusioner? How about a Cod? You can get one now.
### 1.13 and 1.13.1-ready
* You need one of the shiniest versions if you want all these new heads.
