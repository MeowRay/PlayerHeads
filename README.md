# Where's the Source!?
The main project combines different code from multiple modules - you need to look into those module directories for the code.

For the code behind core plugin behavior and classes that can be used as an API, and for documentation, see the **PlayerHeads-core** module.

Otherwise, you can check out the **-support** modules for any server-specific implementation code
